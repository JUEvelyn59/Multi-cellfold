## Project 3: Replication of Paper titled "Multicell-Fold: geometric learning in folding multicellular life"

Term: Fall 2024

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate and validate the findings of the paper *Multicell-Fold: Geometric Learning in Folding Multicellular Life* by Haiqian Yang, Anh Q. Nguyen, Dapeng Bi, Markus J. Buehler, and Ming Guo. The main goal is to assess the accuracy of the geometric deep-learning workflow described in the paper, particularly in predicting local cell-cell junction rearrangements. The dataset used in this study was originally developed for the project *Deconstructing Gastrulation at Single-Cell Resolution*, conducted at Princeton University in 2022 by Tomer Stern, Stanislav Y. Shvartsman, and Eric F. Wieschaus.
